### Hi there 👋

As a data scientist with a passion for problem-solving, I am constantly seeking new ways to turn real-world data into actionable insights. My diverse background in linguistics, mathematics, and law allows me to approach problems from multiple angles. I am committed to bridging the gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders, using effective communication and intuitive visualizations to make complex topics simple.
